      <h1 class="lightblue col-lg-4">&nbsp;What Brand?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1> 
	  
  <div>
  <a href="https://www.bratz.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2022-10-06 at 10.51.32 AM.png" alt="Bratz webpage" width="300" height="194" class="sectionRight"></a>
<p class="col-lg-9">Choosing a favorite brand was a bit difficult for me. However, after we looked at the example website in class, I turned to websites for inspiration. Ever since I was a kid, I loved the aesthetic of Bratz and barbie dolls. As I have grown older, I am really inspired by the fashion aspect of these brands, and how they are able to continue to create these characters. A lot of the fashion and colors that are used for Bratz dolls now are very year 2000 inspired, and I like the way their website uses that look. Their website has sort of a digitally vintage look to it and reminds me of 2000 cyber punk fashion. The center of the brand is the dolls, so a variety of dolls appear on the home page, and it is visually captivating for the viewers.</p>

	   <img src="images/Screen Shot 2022-10-06 at 10.51.27 AM.png" alt="Bratz webpage" width="360" height="194" class="sectionRight"/>
     <div class="pt-3 col-lg-9">
		  <h1 class="lightblue col-lg-5">Why?&nbsp;</h1>  
		  
              <p class="col00g-9">The reason I took inspiration from the Bratz webpage is mostly because of how visually pleasing it is to look through. It has a running banner across the top of the page where you can select different pages easily. I also really love the colors and fonts they have because they are cute but do not distract from the product. There seems to be a digital glitch like filter and moving backgrounds which further emphasize the still dolls. I also like the fact that you can either go for bold bright colors or softer glow-like ones. It feels like a video game I would play on the computer as a kid.</p>

<h1 class="lightblue col-lg-4">&nbsp; My Logo Banner&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="col-lg-9">For my logo header I want it to be bright and bold. Although I am drawing inspiration from the Bratz website, I want to keep the center of my design very y2k. I want my website to be colorful, but I want to use monochromatic blues. I also think a lava lamp background could work well with the colors I have chosen. Ultimatley, I chose a blue glitch back ground, and I think the bubbles really accent my page.</p>
	  
	    <h1 class="lightblue col-lg-5">&nbsp;What do I Plan to Use?&nbsp;</h1>  
    <p class="col-lg-9">I plan to use bolder colors from the website. I like how the colors are like a lava lamp, even in the way they move as a background. Text-wise, I found a very similar free use font called Russo One, which is like the Bratz logo font. The rest of the font is a digital typewriter font, and I will probably use space mono because it is super similar. Right now, I am open still to changing fonts if I need to though. I want a very 2000’s digital feel, like websites I would visit as a kid, with bright colors and a simplistic vibe.</p>
