    <p class="col-lg-12">&nbsp;Movies and television are one of the biggest media platforms in America. They hold so much power in the way that they can reach so many people of all ages and backgrounds. Movies mirror the society that we live in and can influence us in how audiences view their surroundings and other people. Throughout the years the portrayal of people of color has dramatically changed with societal changes in America. Race in America is such a broad topic, but it is so heavily reflected in movies and can help us better understand where we are today. Just as race is simply a social construct, the characters we see on screen are equally socially constructed. Hollywood and audiences work hand in hand to uphold this framework which can either positively or negatively affect minorities. For the purposes of this assignment, I have centered my research on 4 major eras of African American representation in film.</p>

    <p class="col-lg-12">One key reason why making strides in racial depictions in film has been so slow is because our society has struggled to make those same strides. In a lot of ways, we can follow how America evolved through film.</p>
	  
	     <h1 class="text-center lightblue">Black representation in early Hollywood&nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="col-lg-12">&nbsp;During this time period, one of the only roles African Americans played in films where those in which their characters upheld and were submissive to white supremacy. This is seen through the “mammy” character. Black women in servitude to white men and families. One prime example of this comes from the 1939 film “Gone with the Wind”. Actress Hattie McDaniel plays Scarletts servant, and it stereotypically made to be incompetent and uneducated. She is also portrayed to be content with how she is treated, which sends the message to audiences that it is acceptable. Further perpetuating stereotypes of the time and telling black people that this is how it should be. Essentially this film set back millions of African Americans by making it seem like “mammy” was eager and happy to serve her white master. Under the same umbrella, the 1942 musical “Holiday Inn” also contains a mammy character and introduces one of early Hollywood's most problematic trends: blackface. Black face simply put was white actors performing as African Americans. Not only was it a way to push black people out of the film industry but it was a way for whites to mock them on screen. A now cut out scene from the film shows actors Bing Crosby and Linda Mason performing a musical number in blackface. It was such an accepted form of entertainment at the time and was dehumanizing for blacks everywhere. Although blackface has died in the industry, the harm it caused for African Americans made integration into the world of film even more difficult. Although extremely racist and harmful, roles like these were some of the only available spots for African Americans to be actors. Society did not want or expect black people to be portrayed as real people.</p>
	   <h1 class="lightblue col-lg-4">&nbsp;Sidney Poitier: A symbol of change&nbsp;</h1> 
    <div class="row">
		    <div class="col-lg-6"><img src="images/Sidney Poitier.jpg" width="400" height="450" alt="Sidney Poitier"/>&nbsp;</div>
		    <div class="col-lg-6">Entering in to late 1960’s more and more opportunities began to open for black actors. With the premier of “Guess who’s Coming to Dinner” in 1967 audiences were able to see actor Sidney Poitier play a leading role. The first black man to play a leading role was Sam Lucas back in 1914, but he was cast as an uncle tom character which is representative of early Hollywood. Although this isn't the first occurrence of a black man in film, it was one of the first times we see a black man as a love interest. Poitier had a successful career where he often played an educated black man which was rarely seen before. His films challenged the stereotypes the black characters that came before him by presenting black culture in a new way. Known now as one of the most influential black actors of our time, he diversified the acting industry, as well as challenged the typical black characters of the past.&nbsp;</div>
		
		  
	     <h1 class="text-center lightblue">The introduction of the “white savior” in film&nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="col-lg-12">&nbsp;With all the positive changes taking place, we cannot ignore all the mistakes in between. One major issue that we still see today in modern cinema is the white savior complex. Movies like “The Help” and “Hidden Figures” almost completely center their plot around white people coming to save African American characters. Easily disguised as uplifting for the black community, it is a covert display of dehumanization and racism as well. Another Prime example is the 2009 movie “The Blindside” starring Sandra Bullock. Although widely considered a feel- good film, it reinforces structural racism for the black community. With a black man's success story come the wealthy white women who got him there. Audiences can internalize this idea and it can become as harmful as early Hollywood depictions of black culture.</p>
		    <h1 class="text-center lightblue">How far black cinema has come today&nbsp;</h1>
    <p class="col-lg-12">&nbsp;In modern cinema, some the most influential actors of our time are African American. Films like “Black Panther” would simply not have been possible even 20 years ago. Nowadays we not only see black characters properly depicted as regular people, but black pride in cinema is now possible. Furthermore, intersectionality is seen more and more in film. “Moonlight” premiered in 2016 and follows the journey of a young gay black man on his own identity journey. African American cinema has now reached a point where we can examine more things at once rather than just racial acceptance. There is more work to be done, but the pioneers of the past have paved an easier path for all minorities in film today. Starting back in 1914 with the film “Uncle Toms Cabin” black culture represented in film has gone from stereotypes to powerful leads.</p>
